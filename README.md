# UFOs - Fact or Fancy?

## Overview of the Project
- The purpose of this analysis was to provide an easier way to sort through and view previous UFO sightings by location, date and shape.<br>This interactive website was created with a table of information we retrieved from the data provided.

## Results
- On this interactive website there are several ways to filter the data through. We can use our input boxes to filter the data by the following:
    - writing the state(e.g. nj)
    - country abbreviation(e.g. us)
    - city names(e.g. colonia)
    - shape of the UFO(e.g. light)
    - dates of sighting (e.g. 1/1/2010).
 - Example below.<br>

## Summary
- One major drawback on our interactive webpage is that the data doesn't auto-populate until the user hits enter or clicks anywhere on the page.
- For further development my two additional recommendations would be the following:
    1. Auto-populate while user is filtering the data in the input-boxes.
    2. Pagination of the data for easier viewing of multiple rows without scrolling.
